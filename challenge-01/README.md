# CHALLENGE 1 Sequential sorting algorithms 

Can you do
1. A merge sort (with recursion)
2. A quick sort (with recursion)
on arrays with sort keys such as double or strings to your liking?

Nothing is gained if you donâ€™t know whether your programs are correct. Therefore, can
you provide a simple test routine that checks if the resulting array really is sorted?
This test routine should just scan once through the array and should be much, much faster
than your sorting algorithms.
